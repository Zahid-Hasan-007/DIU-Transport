## Overview
This project is a UI design and prototype for the DIU Transport App, designed to improve the user experience of students and faculty members at Daffodil International University (DIU) in accessing transportation services. The app aims to provide a user-friendly interface for booking, tracking, and managing transportation services offered by the university.
